# Project Planning Guidelines

This file defines how to create the `project_details.md` planning document that serves as the single source of truth before issue generation.

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF PROJECT_DETAILS.MD

The `project_details.md` file is created BEFORE any issues are generated. It serves as:

1. **Planning Document** - Complete project blueprint
2. **Review Document** - Team reviews and approves this before issue generation
3. **Single Source of Truth** - All project information in one place
4. **Issue Generation Input** - Used by `/generate` command to create issues

---

## 2. WORKFLOW

```
Step 1: /projectplan <number>
   ↓
Step 2: Creates project_details.md
   ↓
Step 3: Team reviews and requests changes
   ↓
Step 4: Team approves
   ↓
Step 5: /generate <path-to-project_details.md>
   ↓
Step 6: Issues are generated
```

---

## 3. PROJECT_DETAILS.MD TEMPLATE

Every `project_details.md` file MUST follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

---

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Description
[Detailed description of what the project does and what problem it solves]

### 1.2 Target Users
[Who will use this application]

## 5. API Endpoints

### 5.1 Endpoint Table

| Method | Endpoint | Protected | Purpose | LLM Integration | Request Body | Response |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| POST | /api/recordings | Yes | Upload new recording | Yes | {file, userId} | {id, status} |
| GET | /api/recordings | Yes | Get all user recordings | No | - | [{id, title, date}] |
| GET | /api/recordings/:id | Yes | Get single recording | No | - | {id, title, transcription, summary} |
| DELETE | /api/recordings/:id | Yes | Delete recording | No | - | {success, message} |
| POST | /api/recordings/:id/tags | Yes | Add tags to recording | No | {tags[]} | {success, tags} |
| DELETE | /api/recordings/:id/tags/:tag | Yes | Remove tag | No | - | {success, message} |
| GET | /api/search | Yes | Search recordings | No | ?query=text | [{id, title, matches}] |

**Note:** Authentication is NOT listed here because Firebase Auth is handled entirely on the frontend via Firebase SDK. No backend auth endpoints are needed.

### 5.2 Protected vs Unprotected Endpoints

**Authentication (Firebase SDK - Frontend Only):**
- Signup, login, logout handled by Firebase SDK in frontend
- NO backend auth endpoints required
- Firebase token validation can be added to protected endpoints

**Unprotected (Public):**
- Landing page content endpoints (if any)
- Health check endpoints

**Protected (Requires Firebase Auth Token):**
- All CRUD operations on user data
- All data retrieval endpoints
- All LLM processing endpoints

### 5.3 Endpoints Requiring LLM Integration

List endpoints that need LangChain/LLM processing:
- POST /api/recordings (analyze audio with LLM)
- POST /api/recordings/:id/summarize (generate summary)
- GET /api/search (semantic search with embeddings)

| 15 | Search Feature | - | SearchBar | GET /api/search | Combined F+B |
| 16 | Final Testing | - | - | - | Complete flow verification |

### 7.3 Combined Frontend + Backend Issues

When features are strongly connected, combine them:
- Issue 09: Upload Feature (both API and UI together)
- Issue 11: Recording Detail (both API and UI together)
- Issue 14: Tag Management (both API and UI together)
- Issue 15: Search Feature (both API and UI together)

This reduces context switching and helps students understand the complete feature.

## 8. Database Schema (High-Level)

**Note:** Specific fields and relationships are decided by students. This is conceptual guidance only.

### 8.1 Tables Needed

**recordings**
- Purpose: Store recording metadata
- Essential fields: identifier, user reference, file path, timestamps
- Students decide: exact field names, data types, additional fields

**tags**
- Purpose: Store tags for organization
- Essential fields: identifier, tag name
- Students decide: structure and relationships

**recording_tags**
- Purpose: Many-to-many relationship
- Essential fields: recording reference, tag reference
- Students decide: implementation approach

### 8.2 Database Design Principles

- Keep it simple - only essential tables
- Let students design field names and types
- Focus on functionality, not optimization
- Use SQLite for local development
- No authentication data in SQLite (use Firebase)

---

2. **Description** - Expand with more detail
3. **Features** - Copy all features, add implementation approach
4. **Tech Stack** - Apply technology constraints (replace disallowed tech)

### 4.2 Generate Endpoints

Based on project type:
- **Audio projects:** Upload, list, detail, delete, analyze, search
- **Image projects:** Upload, list, detail, delete, analyze, search
- **NLP projects:** Add document, list, search, detail, delete
- **Hybrid projects:** Combine relevant endpoints

### 4.3 Generate Pages and Components

**Standard pages for ALL projects:**
- Landing (/)
- Signup (/signup)
- Login (/login)
- Dashboard (/dashboard)
- Detail view (/:resource/:id)

**Project-specific pages:**
- Based on features (e.g., search page, profile page)

**Standard components for ALL projects:**
- Navbar, Footer, Hero, Features
- SignupForm, LoginForm
- List components, Card components
- LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage

**Project-specific components:**
- Based on features (e.g., AudioPlayer, ImageViewer, SearchBar)

### 4.4 Plan Issues

1. **Issues 1-8:** Always the same (foundation + Firebase auth)
2. **Issues 9-onwards:** Based on features
3. **Combine related frontend+backend work**
4. **Target 15-20 total issues**
5. **Last issue:** Always final testing

## 6. REMEMBER

**This document is for PLANNING, not IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Be comprehensive but not prescriptive
- Provide structure but allow flexibility
- List what needs to be built, not how to build it
- Focus on the big picture
- Make it easy to review and approve
- Ensure it's easy to modify if changes are needed
- This becomes the blueprint for issue generation
