# Technology Constraints

This file defines the strict technology boundaries for all student projects. Students are ONLY familiar with the technologies listed as allowed.

---

## 1. ALLOWED TECHNOLOGIES (STRICT - ONLY THESE)

Students are ONLY familiar with these technologies:

### 1.1 Python Basics
- Variables, functions, loops, classes
- File I/O operations
- Standard library functions
- Basic to intermediate Python

### 1.2 LangChain Basics
- Use LLMs for ANY AI-related tasks
- Basic chains and StrOutputParser
- Simple RAG applications
- Basic vector stores
- NOT allowed: Complex agents, CrewAI, advanced frameworks

### 1.3 FastAPI (CRUD ONLY)
- Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- Basic routing and endpoints
- Request/response models with Pydantic
- Simple middleware
- File uploads
- CORS configuration
- NOT allowed: Complex authentication logic, WebSockets, background tasks

### 1.4 React Basics
- Components, JSX, props
- State Management: useState, useEffect hooks
- React Router DOM for routing
- Fetching APIs: fetch() or axios
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- NOT allowed: Redux, MobX, Next.js, complex form libraries

### 1.5 SQLite (CRUD Data ONLY)
- Local SQLite database
- Basic SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Simple table relationships
- Students design their own schemas
- NOT allowed: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, cloud databases
- **CRITICAL: NOT for authentication - use Firebase**

### 1.6 Firebase (Authentication ONLY)
- Firebase Authentication (email/password)
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase SDK integration in frontend
- **This is the ONLY allowed authentication method**

### 1.7 Basic RAG Applications
- Using LangChain
- Simple vector stores
- Document processing

## 2. PROHIBITED TECHNOLOGIES (STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED)

### 2.1 Authentication & Security
- ❌ JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- ❌ OAuth or OAuth2
- ❌ External authentication providers (Google, Facebook, Auth0)
- ❌ Backend session management
- ❌ Password hashing logic (bcrypt, passlib, hashlib)
- ❌ Session tables or session IDs in database

### 2.2 Processing & Analysis
- ❌ OCR libraries (PyTesseract, Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision OCR)
- ❌ Predefined PDF/image extraction pipelines
- ❌ Complex LangChain chains
- ❌ Forced analysis pipelines

### 2.3 Deployment & Infrastructure
- ❌ Docker or Docker Compose
- ❌ Kubernetes
- ❌ Any containerization tools
- ❌ Cloud deployment configurations
- ❌ CI/CD pipelines

### 2.4 Databases & Caching
- ❌ PostgreSQL, MySQL
- ❌ MongoDB, Redis
- ❌ Cloud databases (AWS RDS, Azure SQL, etc.)
- ❌ Database replication or clustering

### 2.5 Background Processing
- ❌ Celery
- ❌ Background workers
- ❌ Task queues
- ❌ Schedulers (cron, APScheduler)

### 2.6 Advanced Frameworks
- ❌ CrewAI or complex multi-agent systems
- ❌ Next.js (use React + Vite)
- ❌ GraphQL
- ❌ WebSockets (unless absolutely necessary)
- ❌ Microservices architecture

## 3. TECH STACK REPLACEMENT RULES

When project_ideas.md mentions disallowed tech, AUTOMATICALLY REPLACE:

| Mentioned | Replace With | Reason |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| PostgreSQL/MongoDB | SQLite | Students only know SQLite |
| JWT/OAuth/Session auth | Firebase Auth | Only allowed auth method |
| Docker | Remove entirely | Run locally only |
| Redis/Celery | Remove entirely | No background processing |
| Next.js | React with Vite | Students know React basics |
| PyTesseract/OCR | LangChain + LLM | Use LLMs to understand files |
| Complex ML models | LangChain basics | Keep it simple |
| CrewAI | Simple LangChain | Basic chains only |

---

## 4. VALIDATION RULES

**PRE-GENERATION VALIDATION:**
1. Check if technology is in allowed list
2. If NOT → Apply replacement from Section 3
3. If no replacement → REMOVE the technology mention
4. Continue with allowed technologies only

**DURING GENERATION:**
- Scan every step, every action for technology mentions
- Validate against allowed list
- Replace or remove disallowed technologies immediately
- Never proceed with forbidden technologies

**IF IN DOUBT:**
- Use simpler, more basic technology
- Reference only allowed technologies
- Let students implement with what they know
- Follow the replacement rules strictly
