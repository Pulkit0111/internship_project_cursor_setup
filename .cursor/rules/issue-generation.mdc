## 2. GUARDRAILS FOR CONSISTENCY

### 2.1 Format Guardrails (EXACT TEMPLATE STRUCTURE)

**RULE: Every issue file MUST contain these sections in THIS EXACT ORDER:**

```markdown
1. # [Issue Title]                          ← H1 heading, actual title (NOT "## Title")
2. ---
3. ## Summary
4. ---
5. ## Learning goals
6. ---
7. ## Requirements / Acceptance criteria
8. ---
9. ## Step-by-step guide
10. ---
11. ## Time estimate
12. ---
13. ## Constraints
14. ---
15. ## Dependencies
16. ---
17. ## Definition of Done
18. ---
19. ## Raise PR
```

**VIOLATIONS (Will cause INVALID issue):**
- ⛔ Missing ANY section
- ⛔ Sections in different order
- ⛔ Adding extra sections
- ⛔ Using `## Title` heading instead of `# Actual Title`

**EXCEPTION:** Issue #01 (Project Setup) uses README format only (see Section 7)

### 2.2 Content Guardrails (FORBIDDEN CONTENT)

**NEVER generate issues containing:**

❌ Code snippets in any programming language
❌ Variable names, function names, class names
❌ Database table definitions or field specifications
❌ SQL CREATE TABLE statements
❌ JSON schema examples
❌ API request/response examples with actual data structures
❌ Import statements (e.g., `from x import y`)
❌ Configuration file contents
❌ OCR library references
❌ JWT, OAuth, session ID, token, password hashing references
❌ Docker, Kubernetes, containerization mentions
❌ "Confirm password" field references
❌ Backend authentication implementation details
❌ Specific field names (e.g., "user_id", "created_at")
❌ Table column specifications (e.g., "email VARCHAR(255)")
❌ Database relationships (e.g., "foreign key to users table")

**IF FORBIDDEN CONTENT IS ABOUT TO BE GENERATED → STOP AND REPHRASE AS HIGH-LEVEL GUIDANCE**

### 2.3 Required Content Guardrails

**ALWAYS include in every issue (except Issue #01):**

✅ At least 3 learning goals
✅ At least 5 acceptance criteria (checkboxes)
✅ At least 5-7 steps in step-by-step guide
✅ Each step MUST have: Action, Where, Goal, Reference
✅ Time estimate between 60-120 minutes
✅ Both "Blocked by" and "Unblocks" in Dependencies
✅ At least 5 items in Definition of Done
✅ All 8 items in Raise PR section

### 2.4 Naming Guardrails (DETERMINISTIC FILE NAMES)

**File name format:** `issue-XX-descriptive-name.md`

**FIXED FILE NAMES (non-negotiable for first 8 issues):**

| Issue | Exact File Name |
|-------|-----------------|
| #01 | `issue-01-project-setup.md` |
| #02 | `issue-02-landing-page-ui.md` |
| #03 | `issue-03-signup-page-ui.md` |
| #04 | `issue-04-login-page-ui.md` |
| #05 | `issue-05-firebase-auth-setup.md` |
| #06 | `issue-06-integrate-signup-firebase.md` |
| #07 | `issue-07-integrate-login-firebase.md` |
| #08 | `issue-08-dashboard-ui.md` |

**For Issues #09-24:** Use descriptive names following pattern:
- Lowercase only
- Hyphenated words
- Max 5 words
- Pattern: `issue-XX-verb-noun-context.md`
- Examples: `issue-09-create-todo-api.md`, `issue-10-display-todos-dashboard.md`

### 2.5 Issue-Specific Guardrails

**GUARDRAIL: ISSUE #01 (PROJECT SETUP)**
- ⚠️ MUST use README format only (see Section 7)
- ⚠️ DO NOT add issue template sections (no Learning Goals, Acceptance Criteria, etc.)
- ⚠️ Copy VERBATIM from the embedded template
- ⚠️ DO NOT modify, summarize, or regenerate the README
- ⚠️ This acts as: Project context, Tech stack reference, Baseline understanding

**GUARDRAIL: ISSUE #02 (LANDING PAGE)**
- ⚠️ MUST be static UI only
- ⚠️ MUST NOT mention: API calls, state management, routing logic, authentication
- ⚠️ MUST include: Navbar, 3-4 static sections (hero, features, footer)
- ⚠️ NO dynamic content, NO backend interaction
- ⚠️ IF any logic mentioned → REMOVE IT

**GUARDRAIL: ISSUE #03-04 (SIGNUP/LOGIN UI)**
- ⚠️ MUST be static forms only
- ⚠️ MUST NOT mention: confirm password, backend connection, API integration
- ⚠️ MUST NOT mention: password hashing, session storage, validation beyond client-side
- ⚠️ Firebase integration comes LATER in issues #06-07

**GUARDRAIL: ISSUE #05 (FIREBASE AUTH SETUP)**
- ⚠️ MUST focus on Firebase project creation and SDK setup
- ⚠️ MUST NOT mention: SQLite for auth, session tables, password storage, backend auth
- ⚠️ MUST reference Firebase documentation only
- ⚠️ This is configuration issue, not implementation

**GUARDRAIL: AUTHENTICATION ISSUES (#06-07)**
- ⚠️ MUST use wording: "Integrate X with Firebase"
- ⚠️ MUST NOT use wording: "Connect X to Backend" or "Connect X Frontend to Backend"
- ⚠️ MUST NOT include backend authentication logic
- ⚠️ MUST reference Firebase SDK methods (conceptually, no code)

**GUARDRAIL: DATABASE ISSUES**
- ⚠️ MUST NOT provide table schemas or field definitions
- ⚠️ MUST let students decide: fields, relationships, data types
- ⚠️ MUST keep guidance conceptual: "Design tables to store X information"
- ⚠️ MUST NOT include SQL statements or column specifications

### 2.6 Technology Guardrails (HARD BOUNDARIES)

**IF TECHNOLOGY MENTIONED IS NOT IN ALLOWED LIST → REPLACE OR REMOVE**

**Validation on EVERY step, EVERY action:**
1. Check if technology is in allowed list
2. If NOT → Apply replacement from Section 1.3
3. If no replacement → REMOVE the technology mention
4. Continue with allowed technologies only

**Example replacements during generation:**
- "Set up PostgreSQL database" → "Set up SQLite database"
- "Implement JWT authentication" → "Integrate Firebase Authentication"
- "Use OCR to extract text" → "Use LLM via LangChain to understand the content"
- "Deploy with Docker" → REMOVE entirely

### 2.7 Dependency Guardrails (LOGICAL FLOW)

**FIXED DEPENDENCY RULES (non-negotiable):**

```
Issue #01 → Unblocks: #02, #03, #04, #05

Issue #02 → Blocked by: #01 | Unblocks: None
Issue #03 → Blocked by: #01 | Unblocks: #06
Issue #04 → Blocked by: #01 | Unblocks: #07
Issue #05 → Blocked by: #01 | Unblocks: #06, #07

Issue #06 → Blocked by: #03, #05 | Unblocks: #08
Issue #07 → Blocked by: #04, #05 | Unblocks: #08

Issue #08 → Blocked by: #06, #07 | Unblocks: (project-specific CRUD issues)
```

**VALIDATION RULES:**
- ❌ No circular dependencies
- ❌ No issue blocked by a later issue number
- ❌ Every issue (except last few) must unblock something
- ✅ Dependencies must form a logical DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

### 2.8 Time Estimation Guardrails

**MINIMUM:** 60 minutes (no issue less than this)
**MAXIMUM:** 120 minutes (no issue more than this)

**SCALING RULES:**

| Issue Type | Time Range | Rationale |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Static UI pages (no logic) | 60-75 minutes | Simple HTML/CSS/JSX |
| UI forms with state | 65-80 minutes | State management complexity |
| Firebase setup/integration | 70-90 minutes | Configuration + SDK setup |
| CRUD API endpoint | 60-80 minutes | Standard FastAPI patterns |
| Frontend-API integration | 60-75 minutes | Fetch + display logic |
| LangChain/LLM feature | 90-120 minutes | AI integration complexity |
| Multi-component feature | 100-120 minutes | Multiple moving parts |

**IF TIME < 60 OR TIME > 120 → ADJUST TO FIT BOUNDS**

### 2.9 Abstraction Guardrails (WHAT NOT HOW)

**Issues MUST describe WHAT to build, NEVER HOW to build it**

**ALLOWED PHRASES:**
- ✅ "Create a component that displays..."
- ✅ "Build an API endpoint that handles..."
- ✅ "Implement a form that collects..."
- ✅ "Set up Firebase authentication for..."
- ✅ "Design a database to store..."
- ✅ "Use LangChain to analyze..."

**FORBIDDEN PHRASES:**
- ❌ "Create a function called X that..."
- ❌ "Define a table with columns X, Y, Z..."
- ❌ "Use the following code..."
- ❌ "Import X from Y..."
- ❌ "Set the variable X to..."
- ❌ "Add these fields: field1, field2..."
- ❌ "Create a table called users with..."

**STUDENT DECISIONS (never prescribe):**
- Database field names
- Table relationships
- Function/variable names
- Component structure details
- State shape
- API response format specifics

**IF OVER-DEFINED → ABSTRACT TO HIGHER LEVEL**

### 2.10 Validation Checkpoints (SELF-VERIFICATION)

**PRE-GENERATION CHECKLIST (Before generating EACH issue):**

□ Issue number is correct (01-24)
□ File name follows exact pattern
□ No forbidden technologies will be mentioned
□ No code snippets will be included
□ Dependencies make logical sense
□ Time estimate is within 60-120 minutes
□ All required sections will be present

**POST-GENERATION CHECKLIST (After generating EACH issue):**

□ Title is H1 heading (format: `# Actual Title`, not `## Title`)
□ All 10 sections present in correct order
□ No confirm password mentioned
□ No backend auth logic included
□ Firebase for auth (if auth-related)
□ SQLite for data (if data-related)
□ LangChain for AI (if AI-related)
□ Abstraction level appropriate
□ No OCR/predefined schemas
□ No code snippets anywhere
□ Time is 60-120 minutes

### 2.11 Escape Prevention Guardrails

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Add "bonus" or "optional" sections
- ❌ Include "advanced tips" or "pro tips"
- ❌ Suggest alternative approaches
- ❌ Provide multiple implementation options
- ❌ Add explanatory notes outside template structure
- ❌ Include personal recommendations or opinions
- ❌ Deviate from the exact template structure for ANY reason

**IF TEMPTED TO ADD EXTRAS → STOP, FOLLOW TEMPLATE EXACTLY**

**DO NOT HALLUCINATE:**
- ❌ Invent technologies not in allowed list
- ❌ Reference libraries not taught to students
- ❌ Create complex architectures
- ❌ Add features not in project_ideas.md
- ❌ Generate more than 24 issues per project
- ❌ Skip any issue numbers (must be sequential)

**IF UNSURE → USE THE SIMPLER, MORE ABSTRACT OPTION**

---

## 4. CONTENT RULES

### 4.1 What to Include (REQUIRED)

✅ High-level guidance on WHAT to build
✅ Phrases like "Create a component that...", "Build an endpoint that...", "Set up..."
✅ Links to official documentation (React, FastAPI, Firebase, LangChain docs)
✅ File locations (frontend/src/components/, backend/routes/)
✅ Clear goals for each step
✅ Learning objectives appropriate for beginners
✅ Acceptance criteria as checkboxes
✅ Clear dependency mapping (Blocked by / Unblocks)

### 4.2 What NOT to Include (FORBIDDEN)

❌ ANY code snippets or example code
❌ Specific variable names, function names, or implementation details
❌ Code examples in markdown code blocks
❌ Step-by-step coding instructions
❌ Implementation patterns or boilerplate
❌ Database table definitions or field specifications
❌ SQL statements
❌ JSON schemas
❌ API request/response structures with actual field names
❌ Import statements or configuration snippets
❌ OCR library references (PyTesseract, Tesseract, etc.)
❌ Authentication backend logic details
❌ Password hashing code or logic
❌ Session management implementation
❌ References to "confirm password" fields

### 4.3 Writing Style Examples

**✅ GOOD EXAMPLES (High-level, abstract):**

```
Action: Create a signup page component that displays a form for collecting user credentials. Use Firebase SDK methods to handle registration when the form is submitted. Redirect users to the login page on successful signup.

Action: Build an API endpoint that accepts file uploads and stores them appropriately. Use LangChain to analyze the file content with an LLM and save the insights to the database.

Action: Design a database structure to store todo items with their relevant information. Students should decide what fields are needed based on the application requirements.

Action: Implement a landing page with a navbar, hero section, feature cards, and footer. Keep it static with no dynamic functionality.
```

**❌ BAD EXAMPLES (Too specific, prescriptive):**

```
Action: Create a signup function like this:
async function signup(email: string, password: string) {
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
    ...
}

Action: Create a users table with these columns:
- id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- email: VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
- password_hash: VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL

Action: Import Firebase like this: import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
```

## 6. AUTHENTICATION RULES (FIREBASE ONLY)

### 6.1 Core Authentication Principles

**ONLY Firebase Authentication is allowed. Period.**

**✅ ALLOWED:**
- Firebase Authentication SDK
- Firebase email/password authentication
- Firebase Realtime Database (if needed)
- Frontend Firebase integration
- Auth state management in frontend

**❌ NEVER ALLOWED:**
- Backend authentication logic
- SQLite for storing users/passwords
- Password hashing in backend (bcrypt, passlib, hashlib)
- Session tables in database
- Session IDs or tokens
- JWT creation or validation
- OAuth implementation
- Custom auth logic in FastAPI

### 6.2 Required Wording

**✅ CORRECT WORDING:**
- "Integrate signup with Firebase"
- "Integrate login with Firebase"
- "Connect the form to Firebase Authentication"
- "Use Firebase SDK to authenticate users"

**❌ INCORRECT WORDING (NEVER USE):**
- "Connect signup frontend to backend"
- "Connect login frontend to backend"
- "Implement signup API endpoint"
- "Implement login API endpoint"
- "Hash the password before storing"
- "Create session in backend"

### 6.3 Authentication Issue Flow

```
Issue #05: Firebase Auth Setup (configure SDK, create project)
↓
Issue #06: Integrate Signup with Firebase (registration flow)
↓
Issue #07: Integrate Login with Firebase (authentication flow)
↓
Issue #08: Dashboard (protected route with Firebase auth check)
```

### 6.4 What Students Will NOT Do

Students will NOT:
- Create user tables in SQLite for authentication
- Hash passwords
- Generate tokens or session IDs
- Implement backend authentication endpoints
- Verify credentials in backend
- Manage sessions in backend

Students WILL:
- Set up Firebase project
- Configure Firebase SDK in frontend
- Use Firebase methods for auth
- Handle auth state in React
- Protect routes based on Firebase auth state

## 7. ISSUE #01 TEMPLATE (PROJECT SETUP README)

**IMPORTANT:** Issue #01 is ALWAYS "Project Setup" and uses README format (NOT issue template format).

Copy this VERBATIM as `issue-01-project-setup.md`:

```markdown
# Project Template

This template includes a FastAPI backend with Google Gemini LLM integration and a React frontend with Tailwind CSS.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── Backend/          # FastAPI backend application
│   ├── main.py       # Main backend server file

    │   └── index.css # Global styles with Tailwind
    ├── package.json
    └── tailwind.config.js
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.12+** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Node.js 18+** - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Google API Key** - Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

## Backend Setup

### 1. Navigate to Backend Directory

```bash
cd Backend
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
touch .env

# On Windows
type nul > .env
```

Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### 5. Run the Backend Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend server will start at: **http://localhost:8000**

- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
- Random Quote Endpoint: http://localhost:8000/api/random-quote

## Frontend Setup

### 1. Navigate to Frontend Directory

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the Frontend directory:

```bash
cd Frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Frontend Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start at: **http://localhost:5173** (or another port if 5173 is busy)

## Testing the Connection

1. Make sure both servers are running:

   - Backend: http://localhost:8000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173

2. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5173

3. Click the "Generate Quote" button

4. You should see a random inspirational quote generated by the AI!

## Available Endpoints

### Backend Endpoints

- `GET /` - Welcome message
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/random-quote` - Sample endpoint to connect Frontend and Backend (generates random quote using Gemini LLM)

## Development Commands

### Backend

```bash
# Run development server with auto-reload
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Run on specific port
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

### Frontend

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework
- **Uvicorn** - ASGI server
- **Google Generative AI** - Gemini LLM integration
- **python-dotenv** - Environment variable management

### Frontend

- **React 19** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESLint** - Code linting

## Next Steps

Once everything is running fine, here are some steps to extend this template:

1. **Create your own backend endpoints**

   - Add new API endpoints in `Backend/main.py`
   - Use FastAPI decorators like `@app.get()`, `@app.post()`, `@app.put()`, `@app.delete()`
   - Test your endpoints using the Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs

2. **Integrate new endpoints to the frontend**

   - Create new components in `Frontend/src/components/` folder
   - Update `Frontend/src/App.jsx` to include your new components
   - Use `fetch()` or libraries like `axios` to make API calls
   - Handle loading states and errors appropriately
   - Update the UI to display the data from your new endpoints

### Dynamic Content Generation Rules:

**RULE: Adjust content based on project type:**

1. **Project Description**: Extract from project_ideas.md
2. **Features List**: Extract all bullet points from project features
3. **Data Flow Diagram**: Choose appropriate ASCII diagram:
   - Audio projects: Audio → Transcription → Summary flow
   - Image projects: Image → Analysis → Results flow
   - NLP projects: Query → Search → Response flow
   - Hybrid projects: Combine multiple flows
4. **API Endpoints**: Generate based on main resources matching the actual endpoints in issues #09-24
5. **Project-Specific Notes**: Add any unique details from project_ideas.md

**RULE: Use ASCII diagrams for readability:**
- System architecture shows component relationships
- Data flow shows step-by-step process
- Use box-drawing characters for visual clarity
- Diagrams must render properly in any markdown viewer

**RULE: API Endpoints must match issues:**
- Review issues #09-24 for actual endpoint names
- Use consistent naming (e.g., /api/recordings not /api/audio)
- Include only endpoints that exist in the issues
- Align with the resource names used throughout the project

Generate this for each project with project-specific details filled in.

## 9. DATABASE RULES

### 9.1 SQLite for Data ONLY (NOT Auth)

**SQLite Usage:**
- ✅ Store application data (todos, notes, files, etc.)
- ✅ CRUD operations
- ✅ User-generated content
- ❌ NOT for user authentication
- ❌ NOT for sessions or tokens
- ❌ NOT for passwords

**Firebase Usage:**
- ✅ User authentication (email/password)
- ✅ Auth state management
- ❌ NOT for application data

### 9.2 Open-Ended Database Design

**NEVER provide:**
- ❌ Table schemas or CREATE TABLE statements
- ❌ Field names or column specifications
- ❌ Data types (VARCHAR, INTEGER, etc.)
- ❌ Relationships or foreign key definitions
- ❌ Index specifications

**ALWAYS let students decide:**
- ✅ What tables to create
- ✅ What fields each table needs
- ✅ How tables relate to each other
- ✅ What data types to use
- ✅ What constraints to apply

### 9.3 Database Issue Guidance

**✅ CORRECT (Abstract, high-level):**
```
Action: Design a database structure to store todo items. Consider what information needs to be tracked for each todo and how to associate todos with users.

Action: Set up a SQLite database and create tables to support the application's data storage needs. Students should determine the appropriate schema based on application requirements.
```

**❌ INCORRECT (Too prescriptive):**
```
Action: Create a todos table with these columns:
- id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- user_id TEXT NOT NULL
- title TEXT NOT NULL
- completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0
- created_at TIMESTAMP
```

## 11. TIME ESTIMATES

Realistic estimates for beginner students:

| Issue Type | Time Range | Complexity Factors |
|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Static UI pages | 60-75 minutes | HTML/CSS/JSX, layout, styling |
| UI forms with state | 65-80 minutes | State management, validation |
| Firebase setup | 75-90 minutes | Configuration, SDK setup, testing |
| Firebase integration | 70-85 minutes | SDK methods, error handling, state |
| CRUD API endpoint | 60-80 minutes | FastAPI routing, DB operations |
| API integration | 60-75 minutes | Fetch logic, error handling, display |
| LangChain/LLM feature | 90-120 minutes | LLM integration, prompt engineering |
| Multi-step features | 100-120 minutes | Multiple components, complex logic |

**BOUNDS:** Every issue MUST be 60-120 minutes. If estimated outside this range, adjust.

---

---

## 13. GENERATION WORKFLOW

When `/generate <project-number>` is invoked:

1. **Parse project_ideas.md** for the matching project number
2. **Extract details**: Name, description, tech stack, features, difficulty
3. **Validate tech stack**: Replace disallowed technologies with allowed alternatives
4. **Normalize project name**: Convert to lowercase-hyphenated format
5. **Create folder**: `<project-name>/issues/`
6. **Generate Issue #01**: Copy Project Setup README template verbatim
7. **Generate PROJECT-README.md**: Auto-generate issue flow explanation
8. **Generate Issues #02-08**: Foundation + Firebase auth issues
9. **Generate Issues #09-24**: Project-specific CRUD and features
10. **Apply all guardrails**: Check EVERY issue against all guardrails
11. **Map dependencies**: Ensure logical flow with no circular deps
12. **Validate**: Check against validation checklist
13. **Final verification**: Scan all issues for forbidden content

---

## 14. RESPONSE FORMAT

After generating issues, confirm with:

```
✓ Generated [X] issues for [Project Name] in [folder-name]/issues/

Files created:
- issue-01-project-setup.md (README format)
- PROJECT-README.md (issue flow explanation)
- issue-02-landing-page-ui.md
- issue-03-signup-page-ui.md
- issue-04-login-page-ui.md
- issue-05-firebase-auth-setup.md
- issue-06-integrate-signup-firebase.md
- issue-07-integrate-login-firebase.md
- issue-08-dashboard-ui.md
- issue-09 through issue-24 (project-specific features)

All issues follow:
✓ Guardrails for consistency
✓ Template structure (except Issue #01)
✓ Tech stack constraints (Firebase auth, SQLite data)
✓ Time estimates (60-120 minutes)
✓ Progressive difficulty
✓ Proper dependencies
✓ Abstraction level (WHAT not HOW)
```

---

## 15. REMEMBER (CRITICAL RULES)

**YOU ARE GENERATING ISSUES, NOT CODE:**
- Issues are INSTRUCTIONS for students
- Students figure out HOW to implement based on WHAT you describe
- Every project gets Issue #01 (Project Setup README)
- Tech stack must match allowed technologies ONLY
- No code snippets, only high-level guidance
- Progressive difficulty: setup → simple → advanced
- Clear dependencies between issues
- Realistic time estimates (60-120 minutes)
- Firebase for auth, SQLite for data
- LangChain + LLM for AI features (no OCR, no specialized libraries)
- Students make architectural decisions
- Abstract guidance, not prescriptive implementation
- Follow ALL guardrails on EVERY issue

**IF IN DOUBT:**
- Use simpler, more abstract guidance
- Reference official documentation
- Let students decide implementation details
- Follow the template EXACTLY
- Check against all guardrails before proceeding
