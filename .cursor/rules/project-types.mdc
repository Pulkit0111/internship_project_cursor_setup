## 6. COMBINING FRONTEND + BACKEND ISSUES

### 6.1 When to Combine

Combine frontend and backend into a single issue when:
- The feature is strongly connected (e.g., upload button + upload API)
- Students benefit from seeing the complete feature flow
- It reduces context switching
- The combined work still fits in 90-120 minutes

### 6.2 How to Structure Combined Issues

```markdown
## Step-by-step guide

### Backend Implementation

1. **Set up database and models**
   - Action: Create database structure for this feature
   - Where: Backend/database/
   - Goal: Data layer ready
   - Reference: [SQLite docs]

2. **Create API endpoint**
   - Action: Build the endpoint to handle this feature
   - Where: Backend/routes/
   - Goal: Working API endpoint
   - Reference: [FastAPI docs]

### Frontend Implementation

3. **Create UI component**
   - Action: Build the user interface for this feature
   - Where: Frontend/src/components/
   - Goal: Functional UI component
   - Reference: [React docs]

4. **Integrate with backend API**
   - Action: Connect the UI to the backend endpoint
   - Where: Frontend/src/components/
   - Goal: Complete feature working end-to-end
   - Reference: [Fetch API docs]

5. **Test complete feature**
   - Action: Verify the entire feature works correctly
   - Where: Application
   - Goal: Feature fully functional
   - Reference: Browser dev tools
```

### 6.3 Benefits of Combined Issues

- **Reduced issue count:** 15-20 instead of 20-24
- **Better context:** Students see the complete picture
- **Less switching:** Work on related code together
- **Real understanding:** Learn how frontend and backend connect
- **Faster progress:** Complete features, not fragments
